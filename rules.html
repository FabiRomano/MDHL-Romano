            whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary
            action regardless of technical hockey background, expertise,
            accomplishments or standing.

              Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within a
              given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions
              should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and
              older.

              100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in
              the state competition program that are unable to provide a field
              that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
              Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to
              inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a
              waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from
              leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an
              acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.
